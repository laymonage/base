At work, we've finally wrapped up the project we've been working on in these
past few weeks. There are still some bugs to be fixed, but they're relatively
minor.

Really glad I made it.

## Time off...?

I initially planned to do some work on giscus this weekend, but I really didn't
have the energy to do it.

I felt like I needed to take some time off programming. So I did. Kind of.

I played [Castlevania: Symphony of the Night][sotn] on my phone, from start to
finish. I really enjoyed it.

After that, I spent the Saturday and Sunday binging [Lupin][lupin] with my
sister. It was good. I feel like they made things a bit too convenient for the
protagonist, though.

I still ended up doing some programming. A friend of mine asked me to write a
scraper to download some files from my university's scholarships website. I had
promised to do it on the weekend.

It didn't require a lot of thinking, so I didn't mind doing it. I initially
wanted to try out [Spatula][spatula], but it seemed overkill for the job.
Besides, I didn't want to spend more time than needed, which would be the case
if I were to learn a new library.

I ended up going with my usual setup -- requests + beautifulsoup4 in a Jupyter
notebook. Works like a charm. I also didn't need to upload the results as I
could just run the notebook on Google Colab and save the files directly to
Google Drive. Sent the link to my friend, done.
