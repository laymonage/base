## Learning ðŸŽµ

I've got back to where I left off a few months ago (with the instrument)! I
still have a long way to go, though. I managed to spend around 20-30 minutes
every day to practice...

...except this weekend. I skipped Friday, Saturday, and Sunday because I'm way
too focused on my side project (we'll get to that later).

My friend shared about the stuff he learned the past two weeks. He learned
about linear regression and SVR. The course that he took leans toward practical
ML, so it doesn't go in-depth on the theory. He also learned some pandas and
numpy basics along the way.

As I suspected, I've already forgotten a lot of the stuff I learned on the
topic. It's good to refresh my memory! I also gave some tips to my friend on
improving the developer experience.

## That projectâ„¢

I spent much of the week working on the project. I opened some issues to
document things that need to be done. I have yet to implement one of the
features I'd like to have, though.

Still, I think it's mostly ready. I'll try to implement that feature within
the next few days, and I'll see about making a proper release next Friday...
