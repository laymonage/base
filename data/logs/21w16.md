  First week of Ramadan, busy at work, taking my time to release my side
  project.

## Ramadan ‚ò™Ô∏è

It's the first week of Ramadan! It's not the same as the Ramadan I usually go
through, for obvious reasons. That was the case last year as well. It feels
off, really.

I remember two years ago I had Iftar with my friends pretty much every weekday
at the campus. We would do our assignments while we wait for the evening. Still
can't believe it's been two years. I miss the vibe so much.

## That project‚Ñ¢

I couldn't do much for the project this week. It turns out that there's still
a lot of work to be done. I'll try to finish it before the end of the month.

## Work

I had to implement some quite complex UI and logic this week. It was not easy
but I think I managed to do quite well. I still have to polish some things,
though.

## Other stuff

There are some other things that happened this week, but I don't think they're
worth sharing. Sooo üòâ
