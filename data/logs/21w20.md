## Eid al-Fitr ☪️

Eid mubarak! Ramadan went by so fast.

I visited some relatives in the area. We didn't go to my grandmother's due to
some travel restrictions.

## Old friends

We decided to also do the sharing sessions beyond Ramadan if any of us has
something interesting to teach. My friend, who's in medical school, shared
about how fever works and how to handle it.  He also shared (again) about
his experiences during clinical training.

I also gave an update to my friend on my learning progress with the
instrument. I couldn't practice much this week because I had to prepare for
my project's release. I did try to play a little bit of something every day,
though.

## That project™

I've released it! It's called [**giscus**][giscus]. I've already written about
it [yesterday][giscus-release].

So, yeah, I spent most of the week polishing stuff and squashing some bugs to
prepare for the release.

Just as I was about to publish the project, I thought about renaming the
project. It was initially called **giscussions**. It's an obvious play on
GitHub Discussions, but I realized that it's a bit too long. I like my project
names shorter.

So, I tried to come up with alternatives. Shortening it to **giscuss** was an
option, but then I thought about something better.

There's a lot of websites out there that use Disqus as their commenting system.
I'm sure a lot of people have already heard about (if not used) it.

Hence, I thought, why not name it **giscus**? It's a nice play on Disqus.
Looking at the name, people could read it as "something like Disqus, but it
uses GitHub instead".

I decided to postpone the release and do the renaming. It went pretty smoothly,
and I'm really thankful for that. Still, I keep telling myself, why didn't I
come up with it sooner? Oh well.

Anyway, yeah, it's officially out now, and you can try it at the bottom of this
page.
