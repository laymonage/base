  Getting there with my side project and installed an SSD in my friend's
  laptop.

## That project

I've got most of the core features working, including pagination. I almost gave
up trying to get [`useSWRInfinite`][useSWRInfinite] to play nicely with the
API. Pagination was tricky because I want the UI to always show the first and
last pages, and load the rest on demand (while still showing the first and last
pages). I think I got it to work, but I'll have to recheck later.

I really want to get this out soon. If everything goes smoothly, I might be
able to release it next week. However, I probably will push it for another week
to polish some stuff.

## Work

I didn't have a lot to do this week. Which is nice because I was a bit
overwhelmed last week.

## Other stuff

I bought a 1TB SSD drive a few months ago using an Amazon gift card I won from
a competition. I haven't got around to install it in my laptop, as that means
I'd have to copy everything over. So the SSD had just been sitting since then,
still sealed.

A friend of mine wanted to buy it. He came by yesterday and asked me to help
install it in his laptop. So I did. Things went smoothly! I also did a fresh
install of Windows and Office on the machine. All good.
