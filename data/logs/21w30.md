My colleagues hasn't finished the work on the backend. Thus, I couldn't do much
at work this week. Instead, I think I'm going to write about other stuff.

I updated my [PR to Django][pr] to better handle backwards-compatibility. I
spent some time trying to figure out how to make the following behavior in
`argparse`:

- Have an optional argument that accepts at most one value at a time.
- That argument can be used multiple times and the values will be appended to
  a list, e.g. `--arg foo --arg bar` would result in `arg` to be
  `['foo', 'bar']`.
- It should be possible to use the argument without any value, e.g. `--arg`
  (like an argument with `action='store_true'`).
- It should be possible to determine whether the argument was provided or not,
  i.e. whether `--arg` is in `sys.argv`. (However, in this context, it's not
  ideal to check `sys.argv` as we're in a method that already accepts a
  `dict` of pre-processed arguments.)

The first two aren't a big deal as you could just create an argument starting
with `--`, then use `action='append'` and `default=[]`.

The last two are what make it tricky, though. In the end, I managed to sort of
get it with the following:

```py
parser.add_argument(
    '--arg', '-a', dest='argument', action='append',
    default=argparse.SUPPRESS, nargs='?', const='',
)
```

Explanation:

- `default=argparse.SUPPRESS` means that if the argument isn't provided,
  then it won't be in the `Namespace` object.
- `nargs='?'` makes the argument consume one value if possible. It falls back
  to `default` if the option string isn't present.
- Combining an optional argument, `nargs='?'`, and a `const` lets you have a
  default value (`const`) for the argument if the option string is present but
  no value is provided (i.e. just providing `--arg`, not `--arg foo`).

The [documentation for `nargs`][nargs] explains it with examples.

I did some housekeeping for giscus and this website. Most of the work is done
towards adding security headers. Both [giscus][giscus] and [this site][base]
went from D to A+.

I've been thinking about trying out game development. I don't think I'd be
doing it as a career, but I'd like to do it just for personal satisfaction.
Plus, I think it would help me appreciate games better.

I have this idea of a custom Half-Life 2 campaign ever since I was in middle
school. I already had the story and setting in mind. I even thought about
utilizing some mechanics of the base game to provide dialogue without any voice
acting.

However, I did not proceed with my idea as I didn't know much about level
design. I mean, I could learn the tools. But it is hard to imagine the
architecture of the buildings and stuff. I want the layouts to make sense, not
just from a gameplay viewpoint, but the architecture as well. And I am no
architect.

So that idea has been in the back of my mind for, what, eight years or so I
think? It's become something sentimental for me. I know it's not easy to
accomplish, and I accept if I would never do. But I know that it's at least
worth a try.

I remember planning to reuse as much stuff from the base game as I could, as
I didn't really know how to code or make assets back then. I don't actually
need to compile the SDK, as most of the work would be just [Hammer][hammer]ing
stuff. However, as now I know a thing or two about programming, I might as well
prepare.

And so this week, I tried to compile the [Source SDK][source] from source
<sup><sub>(heh)</sub></sup>. Which, come to think of it, was probably why I
signed up on GitHub so many years ago.

It's an old technology that's kind of abandoned and under-documented, but the
community is still there. From what I read, you need to use Visual Studio 2013
in order for it to compile without making many adjustments. So I installed it
and compiled the SDK. It went fine.

After playing around with Hammer again, I realized that it might be too soon to
start this project.

I haven't had much experience in game development.

After I consulted this with my friend who's quite experienced in the field, he
suggested that I should start small. Maybe make something with [Godot][godot].

I'm not against the idea. In fact I was thinking about doing it, after knowing
how little I know about level design. However, making a new game from scratch
would require even more ideas, and I haven't got any good ones.

My friend suggested that I could try remaking an existing game. At first I
couldn't think of a game would be feasible and interesting to be remade. Then,
I remembered something.

There's this "lost" game in the Half-Life community that was released back in
the early days of Steam. It's a really short game, but I remember it was very
interesting. It's no longer in the store, but if you're looking in the right
place, you'll still be able to play it. I remember one of the developers
planned for a remake back in 2015 or so, but it seems that it was scrapped.

I think it's a perfect candidate for a remake.

So, I decided to try out Godot.

I installed it and read the docs. I followed the
["Your first game" tutorial][tutorial], which allowed me to quickly learn the
concepts and patterns in Godot. Here's the result:

  style="width: 480px; height: 720px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
  title="Dodge the Creeps!"
></iframe>

Based on my initial impressions, I like Godot. My only comparable experience is
that of Unity, and I think things are much easier to understand in Godot than
Unity.

I like Godot's approach of Scenes and Nodes, which lets you make clean
components for your game. I also really like its Signal implementation for the
pub/sub pattern.

One thing that I'm a bit unhappy about is that the editor doesn't seem to
provide suggestions for global functions like `get_tree()`, so I always have to
type the whole names manually. I haven't tried the VS Code extension, so maybe
it's better there (though I doubt it).

Anyway, looks like I have fun stuff to do for the next weekends!

I watched [Nomadland][nomadland] on Sunday. It was... beautiful. I don't
understand how, but it really captivated me. I think it was hopeful, sad,
heartwarming, and heartbreaking at the same time. And it triggered my itch to
go somewhere far... and just be out in the open.

I even cried at the end, all the way until the credits stopped rolling.
