# base

Yet another incarnation of [my personal website][laymonage], (re)built with
[Astro][astro], [React][react], [TypeScript][typescript], and
[Tailwind][tailwind]. It is currently based on the three previous incarnations
([Next.js][legacy], [Svelte][nook], and [Vue][apex]). I am planning to settle down with this setup
for quite a while, so this website will eventually include most of my blog
posts from all the previous "personal websites" I built.

## Setup

1. `npm install`: install dependencies
2. `npm run dev`: compile and hot-reload for development
3. `npm run build`: compile and minify for production
4. `npm run lint`: lint and fix files
5. `npm start`: serve the compiled build without hot reload
