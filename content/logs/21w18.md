## Musical instrument ðŸŽµ

I've been trying to learn a certain musical instrument for the past few years,
but I'd always dropped it after a few weeks of practice. It's mostly because
I was very busy with university, even on the weekends.

Now that I've finished my study, my schedule is much more predictable. Thus,
I'm picking up the instrument again. I don't want to share much details about
it until I can play some songs confidently, but I can tell you that it has
`str`ings.

One of the reasons why I always stopped learning mid-way is the lack of
motivation. If I only learn by myself and nobody keeps track of my progress,
I easily get demotivated for some reason.

Thus, I'm trying something out with my friend. Once a week, we'll have an
online meeting, taking turns to update our progress on what we learn. Coming
from non-CS background, he's trying to learn machine learning. I picked the
ML course during my study, so I should be able to help out. I bet I'll also
learn new things along the way.

We'll see how it goes!

## Sharing session

Last week, I wrote about the sharing session that I do with my friends during
Ramadan. It's my turn this week!

In fact, I'm going to do it in about 15 minutes from now. I'll talk about web
stuff in general. I'm not preparing any slides, though. I hope I'll still be
able to get things across.

## That projectâ„¢

I managed to get light, dark, and dark dimmed modes working, just like on GitHub.
It's mostly done, I just need to create the landing page and onboarding for
users. I also need to write that small script to wrap the thing.

Anyway, I think it's mostly done. I'll open a public alpha next week, hopefully.

Oh, and have I told you that **you can try it on this very page?** Please do!

your interest.
