## giscus ðŸ’Ž

I added a new feature earlier this week: discussion reactions. Now giscus can
show the reactions to the main discussion (top-level) post. It translates to
reactions to your blog posts/web pages, just like on Disqus.

Someone [suggested][suggestion] the feature and I think that it's a good idea.
I don't know why I hadn't thought of that. Suggestions like this are one of the
reasons why I love open source.

I also [wrote a guide][guide] to self-host giscus. I'd been putting it off for
later, but someone [asked][request] for it, so...

GitHub has also dropped the `GraphQL-Features` header requirement for the
Discussions API, so I can finally [drop my workaround][passthru].

I also did [some][error-handling] [minor][default-css]
[improvements][filter-category] along the way.

Overall, quite a busy week for giscus.

## DjangoCon Europe

I was lucky enough to get a grant this year.

The conference started on Wednesday because there were sprints this year.

Sadly, I still had a lot of work to do on the weekdays, and I already got tired
by the end of the day. The conference schedule was 2 PM - 12 AM my local time.

I couldn't get a good streaming quality with my internet connection for some
reason. Last year, I was able to work around this using a VPN on my private
server. Thanks to my ISP, that trick hasn't been working for the past few
months.

I could only watch a few of the talks and couldn't join any of the QnA session
or the [gather.town][gather-town] stuff.

I feel really bad for not saying hi to the folks I know, especially my GSoC
mentors.

Here's hoping for a better one next year, or the next, or... yeah. In person,
hopefully.

## Other stuff

My ISP really sucks, especially for handling traffic outside my region. As I
said above, I circumvent this issue by tunneling through my server in
Singapore.

However, my ISP has been dropping packets to DigitalOcean servers [since last
year][do-issue], so I had to move to Vultr. That worked fine, until a few
months ago, when the same issue resurfaced.

I did some research to find the alternative, but it seems that
[other][gcp-issue] [platforms][linode-issue] [also][others] got the same issue.

I finally found one that seems fine: [UpCloud][upcloud]. I deployed an instance
and installed WireGuard on it.

It's much, much better now. Really wish I found out about it sooner. I'll have
to catch up with the DjangoCon talks I missed.

Still feeling a bit sad about the stuff I wrote last week. He's doing better
now, but we won't proceed with our plans until August or later.

This week was such a mixed bag, honestly.

I don't feel so good, mentally. It got worse every day until Friday. There was
an issue that I'd rather not talk about.

I really needed to clear my mind -- work has been kinda crazy this week, and
likely the next as well.

I went out for a walk this morning. It's the first time in two months.

I think that helped.
