At work, we're wrapping up the project I've been leading. It's finished, but it
is yet to be released to the staging and production environments.

I made [a small bug fix][giscus-fix] to giscus to handle redirection if the
user refuse to authorize the app. For some reason GitHub doesn't respect the
`redirect_uri` and uses the first specified callback URL instead, which in my
case happened to be `localhost`. I've fixed it and instead of showing an error
message, the user will now be redirected to the original app.

Oh, and we've reached [400 stars][stars]!

With that out of the way, let's get to the fun part!

I found out that a font that I made back in 2018 is used in a popular web comic
series "The Woke Salaryman". I wrote about it a bit [on my Twitter][tweet].

I first found the series months ago on Instagram and thought it was good.
However, I didn't follow the account and forgot about it until a few days ago.

The [latest comic][salaryman] was very popular and people around me were
sharing it. The font caught my attention, so I explored the series again. I
found out that they switched fonts around four months ago. I looked for
distinguishing properties of my font in the comic, and they were all there.

I sent them a DM, and they confirmed that they indeed use my font. I thanked
them and so did they.

They asked how to properly credit me for the font. Well, they didn't really
have to do anything as the font is released under the OFL. I did say that I
would appreciate it if they would put the name of the font on their website.
We'll see, I guess?

On Friday, my friend and I continued our Resident Evil 6 playthrough. We
finished the Chris + Piers campaign. We'll try the other campaigns next week.

Also, Psychonauts 2 was released this week!

I played the original earlier this year. I first played it back in high school,
but for some reason I only played for a few minutes and didn't continue. I am
glad I didn't though, because that means I only had to wait a few months for
the sequel. Both games were released 16 years apart.

I spent most of my weekend playing it. I'm 14 hours in and I'm not even that
far into the game.

So far, I've been really enjoying it! I love how they managed to retain the
original game's aesthetic and make it more modern and lively. It reminds me of
the difference between Portal and Portal 2.

I think I'm going to complete the game 100%, so expect me to spend more
weekends on the game for the next few weeks.

Here are some screenshots!

I also bought some classic novels. I'm looking forward to read some of them
soon. Until next week!
