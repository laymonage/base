I got [my PR merged][pr] to Django. It's really nice to finally fix the issue.

Also, I'm now the #99 of [Django's top contributors][contributors]!

It's probably not for long, but hey, enjoy it while it lasts ðŸ˜„

I also decided to become a teaching assistant once more this semester. Back
when I was still in university, I had been a teaching assistant for five
semesters (out of seven). I took a break after I graduated. I reapplied this
semester because the Web Design and Programming course has been replaced by
"Platform-Based Programming", and I want to see what it's about.

We had our first session on Thursday. Unfortunately, we had some trouble
setting things up (which is understandable because it's the first week). I hope
we'll do better next time.

My friend (who's studying medicine) asked me to proofread his report on a
research study. It was about the effects of Vitamin B-12 in depression. It was
interesting!

I got my second shot of the Astra Zeneca vaccine on Friday. I got the first
dose [12 weeks ago][21w24], so it was quite a while. In between the two doses,
[I might have got COVID][21w26].

Fortunately, the side effects were close to nothing this time. I only felt a
mild pain in my left arm and it was gone after a day or two. Back when I had
the first dose, I got a fever and the pain in the arm lasted for about a week.

I played a chapter of Leon's campaign in Resident Evil 6 with my friend. It was
slightly less action-packed compared to Chris' campaign, but it's still too
much action in a Resident Evil game. I guess the critics were justified.

I also spent a significant amount of time on my weekend playing Psychonauts 2.
It's a lot of fun! Here are some more screenshots I took.

Also, I'm amazed by the portals in this game. They feel seamless and really fit
into the game's mechanics and themes. It's always interesting to see
non-Euclidean maps in video games.

Here's a short clip someone made:

I'm about to enter the final level, but I want to go back to the previous ones
to find all the collectibles I missed. I think I'll finish it next weekend!
