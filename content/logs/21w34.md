  A lot of things were happening and it's kind of overwhelming.

A lot of things were happening at once this week and I don't know how to write
them down. Here goes.

One of my closest friends had his bachelor thesis defense on Thursday. I
visited him on Friday with another friend to congratulate and we gave him some
gifts. We ordered a graduation stole (that sash thing) for him, but that ended
up being quite a mess because:

- I ordered it on Monday so that it could arrive on Tuesday.
- I picked one that's a bit pricey because the material seemed good and so are
  the reviews.
- I had written down specific instructions and text to be put on the stole.
- It arrived on Tuesday, but there was a missing space between the name and the
  degree, making it look like it's for a Master's degree.
- I was very upset, so I wrote a complaint.
- Tuesday was the national independence day so the shop didn't respond until
  Wednesday.
- The shop couldn't fix it but offered to make another one and I'd only have to
  pay for delivery.
- I agreed. I initially wanted to visit my friend on Thursday, so I paid for
  same-day delivery. To thank them and compensate for the hassle, I paid more
  than just the delivery cost.
- The shop sent me a photo of the result. It was missing a period at the end. I
  told them to fix it.
- They said, "Sorry, we've already sent it for delivery because otherwise it
  wouldn't make the same-day deadline."

Ughh.

The thesis defense was at the end of Thursday. I'm afraid it would already be
too dark for a visit, so I decided to visit my friend on Friday. Had I
considered this earlier, I wouldn't mind paying for next-day delivery and
having the thing fixed before I received it.

What a mess. One star review.

Later that night, we had fun playing Resident Evil 6. I've played it years ago
before, but I didn't finish it because I couldn't find a co-op partner. I
convinced my friend to buy the game a few months ago, but we decided not to
play until he finished his bachelor thesis.

It's been months since the last time I went outside, so it was very refreshing
for me. Having fun with my friends also really helped.

My friend was busy this weekend, so we didn't continue playing.

Around three weeks ago, a junior from a student organization at my university
asked me to make a workshop on one of the pre-selected topics. I feel like I've
done enough stuff about Django recently, so I picked the one about making a
portfolio website with Next.js. (I do have one idea for a Django talk, maybe
for a DjangoCon next year.)

The workshop was on Saturday. I had other stuff to do, so I hadn't prepared the
slides until this week. I felt like I hadn't really got the idea on how to
present the topic. The whole week became kinda stressful because I kept
thinking about it. Not to mention the stuff I had to do at work and that I had
to prepare the gifts for my friend.

However, I'm glad I decided to play with my friend on Friday night instead of
preparing the slides. I was too stressed, I couldn't be productive anyway.
Playing and having a chat with my friend actually helped and I was able to
finish the prep the next morning.

Well, sort of. There were things I wished I had included in the slides, but I
managed to verbally address them, so that's fine. Plus, I didn't even prepare
the hands-on material, it was done on the spot. Considering all that, I'd say
the workshop still went pretty well.

I made the [slides][nextjs-portfolio] using [slidev][slidev]. It's my first
time using it. It seems more powerful than reveal.js (which I've used several
times), but it's still lacking transitions. Had a problem with the deployment
but luckily I was able to sort it out before the workshop started.

At work, I became the person in charge of the current project. Even though it's
not a big deal, it also added a bit more stress. Luckily, the project is going
pretty well, despite some hiccups early on.

We also had an event on Monday to commemorate the national independence day.
We did the "paint by numbers" thing. I got the package a few days prior. It was
pretty fun. I didn't win any prizes, though I guess that was to be expected.
<sup><sub>(Still, I lowkey wanted to win.)</sub></sup>

I probably spent too much time on the painting.

I used the leftover paint to make a congratulations card for my friend.

Adam [fixed][deprecation-pr] a `DeprecationWarning` in my
django-jsonfield-backport package. I guess it finally gave me the push to fix
some [other][psycopg-pr] [issues][formfield-pr] as well. Then, [a new
release][backport-104] was issued. That was nice.

I updated [my PR to Django][django-pr] once more. I don't think there's
anything left to change in the approach, so hopefully it'll be merged soon.

GitHub Discussions went out of beta this week. It's got some updates in it, so
[I adapted them to giscus][giscus-update]. Still waiting for some updates to
the API so I can add new features.

For some reason, being alone again on the weekend after having a lot of fun
with my friends the previous day made me feel kinda sad even more. I feel like
I recharge my energy when I socialize with a person or two whom I'm very
comfortable with. Being alone or having too many people at once make me
exhausted.

I tried finding new friends on Reddit, but I haven't had much luck. I managed
to talk to some people, but then it's either we didn't click or they ghosted
me. If possible, I'd love to make new friends my age from outside Asia. I'm
thinking of relocating for a few years to work and live somewhere nice.

There was a quarrel at home, but I'd rather not talk about it.

I cleaned my room just before writing this. I guess that also cleared my mind a
bit.
