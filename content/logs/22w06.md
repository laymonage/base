## giscus ðŸ’Ž

Fixed a nasty bug that could cause a crash. It turns out my workaround for the
footnotes implementation was not correct. [Previously][21w40], I wrote this
paragraph:

The problem is, I used `window.parent.location.href` to get the parent page's
location. The `location` is `undefined` if accessed from a cross-origin
`<iframe>`, making it crash if we try to access `.href`. I did not catch the bug
before because I tested it on the giscus homepage, which means that the
`<iframe>` is on the same domain. [The fix][referrer] is to use
`document.referrer` instead.

There are also some small updates, like Korean localization improvements and
allowing repo ID, category ID, and page `description` to be overridden from the
parent page.

## Work

Spent most of the week explaining the config that I've set up for the project.

Had my last day on Friday. We were supposed to have an offline event, but Covid
has been going pretty wild lately, so we decided to have it online. Each of us
ordered food and we played some games and had some chit chat.

My teammates bought me a [Soundcore Motion+][motion-plus]. I've been meaning to
buy it, but I had been kinda hesitant about it, as my Soundcore 2 still works
just fine. They wanted me to test it with "the instrument", so I did and played
a few tunes.

Anyway, my teammates are great and I enjoyed working with them. I'll be free for
the next two weeks before starting my next job.

## Fun stuff

Watched [Mulholland Drive][mulholland-drive] on Tuesday. What a movie. It was
very confusing and surreal. It's the first time I watched something created by
David Lynch, I heard that's just how he create stuff. It made more sense after
I read some explanations on the internet, though my guess wasn't too
far-fetched. It kinda reminds me of Perfect Blue for some reason.

Also watched [The Game][the-game] on Friday. That was a pretty fun movie. The
twist is... that there's no twist. I liked how the narrative played out.

Sam and I pushed our session to Monday as he's still busy with some stuff.

Went for a morning walk on Saturday. It was refreshing, as always.

Finally installed [Resident Evil 4 HD Project][re4hd] and played through the
first chapter. I recorded my playthrough!

<div style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingTop: "56.25%",
    marginBottom: "4rem",
  }}>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-xhPDSE6pY" title="YouTube" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}></iframe>
</div>

I've played through the game numerous times before, but this is my first
playthrough of the game in six years! I've been following the HD project since
it started back in 2014, and I waited for it before starting another run ðŸ˜†

I'm not satisfied with the mic audio, though. I'll try to change a few settings
in the next recording and see if it helps.

I don't plan on starting a gaming channel or anything, but who knows. My channel
would probably be filled with lots of random stuff. I'll upload anything I want.
