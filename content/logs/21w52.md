Not many updates for now. I'm a little behind on the PRs and issues because I
have been busy with work.

I updated some dependencies and added [minification][minification] of the client
script to the build process.

## Work

I started the process to upgrade our frontend stack from
[Material UI v4 to MUI v5][mui-upgrade]. I ran the codemods, then fixed the lint
issues, and finally fixed the breaking changes.

It was a bit of a hassle because we still had new PRs coming, so I had to do
some rebases. The build has succeeded, but I haven't checked all of the pages
to see if there are any broken UIs.

I'm taking the next Monday to Wednesday off, then we all have the Thursday and
Friday off. I'm also taking the Monday and Tuesday off after that. To put it
simply, I'll be on vacation and will return to work on 5 January.

## Fun stuff

No badminton this week because the courts were fully booked.

I played a lot of Fallout 3 on Friday and Saturday. It's a lot of fun and I'm
really digging the soundtrack and setting.

Sam and I played Resident Evil 6 on Saturday. We finished the Jake+Sherry
campaign and started Ada's campaign. It's the last one, so that means we'll have
to find another game to play.

I watched the [2013 film adaptation][the-great-gatsby] of The Great Gatsby on
Saturday. I enjoyed it. Most parts of the film were pretty faithful to the
book, but there were some details that they left out.

Some of the songs chosen for the soundtrack were a bit disappointing because
they didn't fit. I do think The xx's track fit perfectly with the movie though,
especially the ambient guitar parts.

Overall, I think it's a pretty good movie.

On Sunday, I tidied up my room and threw out some stuff from my university days.
Mostly papers and exams.

That took the whole day and I caught a bad flu from all the dust. At least
that's one thing off the list.

## These logs

This is the last log for the year. I started in [the 10th week][21w10], so that
means there has been 43 logs so far. I'm pretty satisfied with how this turns
out.

I don't have anything to say about it yet. Maybe I'll do something special for
22w09 and/or 22w10. Maybe not.

Anyway...
