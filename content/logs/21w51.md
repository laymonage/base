There were some suggestions for new features and other improvements. I don't
have the energy and time to work on them, yet. I did update some dependencies
and fixed [a minor bug][minor-bug], though.

## Work

I finished the peer review.

We also had an outing on Friday. It was the second time I met my coworkers. We
had lunch together and then chatted until evening.

It was fun. We ate at an all-you-can-eat restaurant, so I ate a lot. Yum ðŸ¥©

## Fun stuff

Sam had an interview for a Software Engineering bootcamp on Thursday. He asked
me to do a mock interview on Wednesday. We thought it was going to be a coding
interview, so we did a few questions. Turned out, it wasn't a coding interview
ðŸ¤·

I played badminton with my high school friends again on Saturday. There were
seven of us and we played at a different court this time. We also had lunch
together after that.

After a quick chat with Sam on Saturday, we played Clone Hero again. A couple of
our friends also joined. We played some Indonesian songs from the 2000s, some
songs from GTA San Andreas, and other stuff from our childhood. It was a
nostalgia trip.

I started playing Fallout 3 on Sunday. I'd been meaning to play it for years,
but I hadn't got into it for some reason.

I love the retrofuturistic setting. The soundtrack mostly consists of 40s-50s
music, which I've loved ever since I played Mafia II and BioShock as they also
have similar soundtracks. I think I'm going to be enjoying it a lot.

I also finished reading [The Great Gatsby][the-great-gatsby]. I initially
started reading it just after I bought it [a few months ago][21w35], but I
found the book to be very hard to read. It uses some old, uncommon phrases that
I don't quite understand. I decided to restart and just tried to push through
it this week. After the first few chapters, it got much easier.

The story was interesting, and I liked how everything played out in the end.

Now I'm curious what the movie adaptation looks like. I think I'm going to watch
it next week.
