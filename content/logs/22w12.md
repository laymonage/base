## giscus ðŸ’Ž

[Added][lazy-pr] an option to use `loading="lazy"` on the `<iframe>`. Also
[made it][anchor-pr] so that the container element's `id` gets appended as an
anchor to the origin URL. This means that the successful login redirect
can automatically bring the user to the comments section. Dependencies have also
been upgraded.

## Work

Learned a lot this week.

Learned about our data privacy practices, the current state of Wagtail's
frontend, and a specific part of the project that I'm working on.

I'm enjoying it a lot!

## Other stuff

[My PR][haskey-pr] to Django has been merged! That means I managed to keep my
contribution streak since Django 3.0.

Completed the slides for my Wagtail Space talk. Will need to record it soon...

Caught up with Sam again after skipping the previous two weeks. He brought some
good news and I was glad to hear it. Still waiting for the results.

Anyway, there were also some other _really_ good things that happened this week.
I'd like to keep them to myself (and maybe a few other people?), though. At
least for now. It's probably been a few months since I felt something like this.

I'm happy ðŸ¥°
