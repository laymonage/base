## giscus ðŸ’Ž

Updated some dependencies. Merged a few bugfixes (again) and a Vietnamese
localization. We now support 14 languages. Keep 'em coming!

## Work

Finally merged the Material UI v4 to MUI v5 upgrade this week. Turns out there
were still some bugs to fix, though.

## Other stuff

Played Yakuza 0 again. Still enjoying it so far.

Watched [Nobody][nobody] with my family on Saturday night. It was good. I was
pretty impressed with Odenkirk's performance as an action star, considering his
previous roles (e.g. Saul from the Breaking Bad universe).

Also decided to watch [Last Night in Soho][soho] on Sunday night. I kinda
expected the twist, but it was still pretty interesting to see it unveiled. As
expected, Edgar Wright's soundtrack choices did not disappoint.

I recorded a cover for a solo part of a song and showed it to Sam on Sunday. I
don't think I'm going to release it publicly... yet. I'd like to cover the full
song and release that instead. Don't know when, though...

Honestly, I've been feeling rather empty these days. I can't really pinpoint
why, but I guess it doesn't really matter. I mean, I probably could. It's just
that it'd be easier if I did not think about it too much.
