## giscus üíé

I've released a new, version 2 of [giscus-component][giscus-component]! It's
been completely rewritten with [Lit][lit] as a [web component][web-component].
Now, the implementations for the React, Vue, and Svelte components share the
exact same code and they only act as a wrapper for the web component. You can
compare the code for the [React][giscus-react], [Vue][giscus-vue], and
[Svelte][giscus-svelte] components and see that they're not that different.

The new implementation allows you to change the configuration without
re-rendering the whole component (which would reload the comments). This is
done by overriding the re-rendering logic into sending a `MessageEvent` to the
`<iframe>` using `postMessage()` every time the props change. Previously, this
wasn't really possible because the `<iframe>` was rendered by the framework.
Now that it's within a web component, we can let the web component decide how
to re-render itself. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work in Svelte as it
always re-renders the component for some reason üòï

Getting the whole thing to be compiled and published (with their TypeScript
declarations) was a pain. I'm using Vite to bundle each component, which
certainly made things a lot easier, but the documentation is still pretty
barebones so I had to scour the web to figure out the quirks and obscure errors
I encountered. [This blog post][build-ts-lib], [this issue][vite-export-types],
and [this issue][preact-lib] were particularly helpful.

I also created a new (orphan) branch from scratch. The [v1 branch][v1-branch]
was forked from [utterances-component][utterances-component], but it had too
many automations and unnecessary stuff that made updating the library such a
chore.

I'm so glad to get it all working in the end! I think I should write a blog post
about it...

There was also some housekeeping stuff on giscus itself, such as updating the
dependencies and updating the GitHub Actions workflow. I also learned about
[`formatToParts()`][formattoparts], which I utilized to
[add spaces between date parts for the Chinese locale][add-spaces].

## Work

We're about to call the MVP a wrap. So glad that my stuff _mostly_ works.

There were also some other introduction meetings which I enjoyed.

## Ramadan ‚ò™Ô∏è

Ramadan started on Sunday. For some reason the vibe isn't quite there this year
‚òπÔ∏è

I hope my friends and I get to do our "TEDx" talks like [last year][21w17].

## Other stuff

My Wagtail Space US talk is now [on YouTube][wsus2022]. It's a bit awkward as
it's a screen recording of a Zoom meeting with my pre-recorded talk played in
the foreground, though. If you'd like to see just the talk itself, I've also
uploaded it to [my channel][wsus-own].

I played Borderlands 2 with a couple of my high school friends on Monday and
Sunday. The last time I played it was back in 2017 when we were about to enter
university. Back then, we only got around to play the first few quests, then we
stopped playing after our study started. This time, we started a new game, and
we've got a bit further than last time. It's a lot of fun to be playing with
them again.

Also played Resident Evil 2 Remake on Saturday. Managed to get around 60fps
after downscaling the quality to 80%. I had to switch to DX11 as I experienced
texture flickering issues with DX12 when the framerate goes below the refresh
rate. I just got to the part where the demo ended. Will play again next week.

Sam hasn't been in the mood for a chat these past few weeks, so we skipped our
session once again.

Meanwhile, I had a chat with a close friend of mine from university. He's the
one who invited me to play [World of Warcraft][21w11] and
[Final Fantasy XIV][21w39]. I'll just call him Nat from now on, as it's highly
likely that I'll mention him again in future logs. Anyway, it's been a while
since the last time, so it was definitely nice to chat with him again.
