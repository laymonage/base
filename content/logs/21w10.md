## Graduation

I had my graduation ceremony yesterday. Technically, I already graduated a few
weeks ago, but now it's official. I'm honored to be one of the
[top five][youtube] students who graduated with the (_summa_?) _cum laude_
distinction.

In the past 3.5 years, university has been a major part of my life. It's been a
very exhausting journey, but it's also been the most impactful so far. I
learned a lot in the process and now I know there's so much I have yet to
learn.

I finished my bachelor thesis two months ago. It's far from perfect and I wish
I'd written some things differently. However, given the time and other
constraints, I did my best. I'm planning to publish the repository over the
next few weeks.

## Last year

It's funny to reflect to where I was last year.

Writing a bachelor thesis is not required to finish the Computer Science
Undergraduate program at my university. I did want to write one, but I couldn't
come up with a topic.

Undergraduate studies at my university normally take 4 years to complete.
Roughly around this time last year, I had no intention of graduating one
semester early. Though I did have the option to do so, as I took some extra
credits over the previous semesters.

Then the pandemic hit and remote learning started. There was no indication that
the pandemic would be over soon (and I was correct). If I had to spend the rest
of my study at home, I would rather finish it as soon as possible.

One afternoon, I did something drastic in an impulse. I decided I would finish
my study and write a bachelor thesis in the seventh semester. I picked my
[Google Summer of Code project][gsoc] as the topic. I know that it feels like
I've talked about it too many times already. However, I figured that it would
be interesting to reflect on it again and let others know about the process
in more details.

## What's to come

Still, this is only a beginning.

I also said that I would take a break for a few months before I start working
full-time. Yet here I am, working full-time as a Software Engineer at
[GudangAda][gada] starting from last Monday. An alumnus from my university
offered me the job a few weeks ago. I'd like to help my family sooner rather
than later, hence I took the opportunity.

It feels weird to see part of your routine getting replaced by something else.
I used to ride my bike to the campus every morning, hoping not to miss the 8 AM
classes. Now it's mostly just me sitting in front of my laptop, in my own room.

Anyway, I figured this would be a good time to start writing these logs. I took
the inspiration from [Simon Willison's][simonw] and
[Carlton Gibson's][carltongibson] Weeknotes posts. I chose to use a somewhat
more general term "logs" for these posts just so that I can be more flexible.
The principle is the same, though: I just want to publish some writings on a
regular basis without trying too much. Let's see if this will work out.
