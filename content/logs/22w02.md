Merged a few bugfixes and a German localization. That's the 13th language to
be added.

Also answered a few questions in the issues. Haven't got the energy to work
on anything else, though.

## Work

Vacation ended on Tuesday, so I went back to work on Wednesday.

I handed in my 30-day notice.

In other news, I also got a draft of the contract for my new job. Will share
more in the coming weeks.

## Other stuff

Finally finished Fallout 3 and all the DLCs on Saturday. I skipped some of the
side quests, though. The game started to become repetitive as I reached the
maximum level, so I decided to just be done with it.

Started playing [Yakuza 0][yakuza-0] on Sunday. The story is pretty
interesting so far. It's also a lot of fun.

Watched [Whiplash][whiplash] on Sunday night. I've been meaning to watch it
since it came out. For a few silly reasons, I kept putting it off for later.
Kinda glad I did, though, because otherwise there would be some things from the
movie that I just couldn't get.

Sam needs some time alone this week, so we skipped our session.

Went for morning walks on Tuesday and Sunday. It's been so long since last time.
It's a simple and relaxing thing to do, plus it kinda helps clear the mind. I
think I'm going to do it regularly from now on.

I still regularly play around with the instrument, but I haven't spent much
effort to actually do real practice.

Also, I think I'm going to try to move these logs to Monday instead of Sunday.
I like the idea of starting the weeks on Monday. Writing on Sundays (or rather,
from a Sunday "perspective") kind of limits me from writing about the rest of
the day, which also means the rest of the week.
