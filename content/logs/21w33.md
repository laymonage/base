I got a new haircut at home on Saturday. I wanted to try to do it myself, but
I was not confident enough.

None of us are barbers or hairstylists, so the result is... unsatisfactory.
Well, it could've gone much worse, though. Just got to deal with this for the
next few weeks.

To make use of the extra space, I did a fresh install of Arch on the new drive.

There's a special tool to
[install Arch from an existing Arch installation][arch-existing], which could
simplify the process. That was my first choice.

Curious, I thought this would be a good time to also switch to a different
desktop environment. KDE has been catching my attention recently.

For some reason, there was an issue that caused SDDM to not load the greeter.
It just showed a blank screen and a cursor. There were also some obscure
D-Bus errors in the logs.

A lot of possible fixes were tried. No luck.

Somehow, reinstalling from scratch (using a bootable USB drive) fixed it. No
idea why.

When it finally booted, a lot of time was spent trying to configure KDE to my
liking. Yet, something always feels off. Plus, migrating some things from my
existing installation just didn't work out of the box for some reason.

There's a lot of configuration options in KDE that you can tweak. Which sounds
good, but... I don't know, it feels a bit overwhelming. And that's weird
because I'm a big fan of customization.

In the end, KDE just didn't click with me. I wiped off the installation again
and... went back to Budgie.

I'm always pleased with how Budgie just looks good out of the box. Combined
with a decent GTK theme, it looks even better. Things just work for me.

Granted, I still had to configure some things. However, things are easier to
find in Budgie. Maybe it's because I've been using it for the past three years,
but I remember feeling the same back then.

For now, work and project stuff are just symlinked from the other drive. Maybe
I'll move/copy them later, but now is not the time.

My old installation was almost borked when GRUB was reinstalled. It was because
of [this irritating issue][grub-issue] with GRUB and os-prober. I vaguely
remember encountering the same problem a long time ago, but I can't remember
how I fixed it. Now, I just borrow the solution from EndeavourOS, which
thankfully works just fine.

So, yeah. That surely took most of my weekend. Which is a shame because there
were some other things I'd rather be doing.

Oh, and the other SSD drive ordered from eBay arrived this week. I'll probably
just sell it later. Probably not.

There's some sort of an exercise routine that I try to follow. It seems to work
out so far. <sup><sub>(heh)</sub></sup>

I haven't been continuing my lessons on the instrument. That said, I still try
to learn stuff on my own or just play some melodies for the fun of it when
there's time.

I think I have made some good progress. Maybe I can make a cover or something
soon? We'll see.

In the meantime, enjoy this song.

Maybe [another one][sunternoon].
