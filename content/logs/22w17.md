## giscus üíé

Not much this week. Updated some dependencies and merged some
[improvements to the zh-TW localization][zh-tw-improvements].

## Work

[Did some more work on snippets.][wagtail-work] We're wrapping the views in a
`ViewSet` and allowing users to customize it, so they can have custom views for
each snippet.

I found some challenges when I tried to implement the `ViewSet`. Luckily, my
manager offered to have a pair programming session so we could figure out how we
would implement the `ViewSet`. We came up with something after about an hour.
That was great!

## Iftar, together (pt. 2) ‚ò™Ô∏è

I had iftar with Nat on Sunday! We went to a cafe in his area. The place was
cozy and the food was good. I had [nasi goreng][nasi-goreng] and he had chicken
katsu. Service was a bit slow, but it's understandable as the place was quite
packed.

We had a nice chat until around 8pm. He's preparing something cool that I'd love
to share once it's released. Anyway, it's nice to see him again in person. Last
time was [near the end of the year][22w01], so that's quite a while.

I rode my motorbike on the way home. There's something about riding alone in the
night that just feels nice. You're doing something, but not really _something_
that occupies your mind, so there's still room to think about things. It's nice.

## Other stuff

Played a lot of Borderlands 2 this week. Sam has joined the game and we decided
to (yet again) restart the game from the beginning. We're playing it a bit more
relaxed this time. It's great as now I could catch some things that I missed in
my previous playthrough.

Also started Claire's campaign in Resident Evil 2 Remake. It's interesting to
see the story from another perspective. I'm halfway to the game and I'll
probably finish it next week.

Oh, and [Better Call Saul][better-call-saul] returned for the first part of the
final season this week! I've waited so long for this. I've been following the
show since the first season back in 2015, my second semester of high school.
It's going to be so satisfying to see the it end.

On the drawing I made last week, I can't show it here yet. It's made for someone
but I can't show it to him until next week. Once he sees it, I'll put it here.
