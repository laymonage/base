## giscus ðŸ’Ž

The loading state now uses GitHub's Mona loading animation that shows up on your
homepage:

![GitHub loading animation][mona-loading-default]

Also made some styling and accessibility fixes. Dependencies have been updated,
but I had to revert the upgrade to React 18 due to an issue with
[Preact][preact-issue]. It doesn't really matter, as we only use Preact
anyway...

Meanwhile, on giscus-component, new versions have been released. It's just to
[fix an outdated link][issue-link-bugfix] in the error suggestion. The Svelte
component, however, had quite [an important bugfix][svelte-bugfix], as I
accidentally wrap the component in a `<main>` element.

## Work

We've been planning for some work that will bring new features to Wagtail. Nice
to get to work on open source again ðŸ˜„

## Other stuff

I didn't play Borderlands 2 this week. I did, however, play Resident Evil 2
Remake again. It's fun and quite challenging sometimes. I don't think it's
_that_ scary, but being chased by Mr. X does give me the adrenaline rush.

Sam had some really good news on Thursday. I felt so relieved to hear it.

We had our session on Sunday night. I showed a bit of my progress on the
instrument. Also, on Friday I just discovered that I can easily hook it up with
GarageBand using a cable that I own. Looks like that cover might finally be
made... ðŸ‘€

Anyway, we also talked about "the news" and we jokingly made a plan that might
just become a reality by the end of the year. We'll see!
