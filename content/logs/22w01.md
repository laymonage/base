  It's pretty hard to find. Even harder to keep.

I'm on vacation, so there are no updates on work and giscus.

It feels kinda weird to not write code for more than a whole week.

---

A close friend of mine just got back from a trip and he got me a gift.

We met at a bookstore on Tuesday. I didn't buy anything from the store, though.
It's just that the place isn't far from his, and we're both familiar with it.

It's been almost two years since I last saw him in person, so it's really nice
to see him again.

There was a family birthday on Wednesday. My aunts and cousin visited us to
celebrate.

---

We didn't do anything for new year's eve. I mean, we never really do anything
for it every year anyway, so it's nothing bad. Sometimes we would visit a
relative and celebrate the occasion with them, but we haven't done that in
years.

I even kinda slept through it. I woke up at around 23:58 because I heard the
fireworks. I waited a bit until a few minutes past midnight and I went back to
sleep.

Despite being on vacation, I don't really feel happy. Not overly sad, either.
Just... I don't know how to put it in words.

For a last/first week of the year, it's much tougher than usual.

I initially planned to complete the documents needed to get my transcript. Yeah,
it's been almost a year since I graduated and I haven't got around to it. With
the way things went this week, though... I'm just gonna push it for later.

And so, I didn't do much for the whole week. Most of the days were spent playing
Fallout 3. It's a vast game and I've spent more than fifty hours on it. I'm
about to get to the ending.

On Saturday, I played badminton early in the morning with my friends. Then we
had breakfast together at McDonald's.

I wanted to go for a walk on Sunday, but my preferred area was closed, so I went
back home. That was a bit disappointing. Thankfully, the ride back home was
quite relaxing.

Sam and I played [We Were Here][we-were-here] on Sunday. For a free game, it's
nice and short. We spent too much time on some of the puzzles because we were
thinking too far. It's pretty fun, though!

I chatted with Sam for a few hours after that. Talking about the things that
happened this week was comforting.

I really hope it gets better.
