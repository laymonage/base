No updates this week.

## Work

Still figuring things out. We use this fascinating piece of software called
[telepath][telepath] that acts as a bridge between Django and React. It's really
nice because you can utilize React for fancy UI stuff and keep the complex logic
(including form validation) in Django. I still need to gather a lot of context
on how we use it in our project, though.

There was also a brief meeting to introduce me to how we do frontend stuff for
client projects. Learned about the existence of
[django-pattern-library][django-pattern-library] from that. The client project
things aren't that relevant for me yet because I'm mainly working on Wagtail
(and a related, in-house product). However, it's still nice to know and it'll
probably be useful if I ever get my hands on a client project, which is highly
likely.

## Other stuff

Got my booster shot on Wednesday. We were supposed to either get the Moderna or
Pfizer vaccine, but the hospital ran out of those. AstraZeneca once more ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰.

Sent [a PR][haskey-pr] to Django to fix a bug in `HasKeyLookup`. Not very proud
of the current solution, but at least that worked. Looks like it still needs
improvement.

On Sunday, I tried to start preparing the slides for my Wagtail Space talk. It
was raining and the power went out just as I was about to get started. It went
back up after about an hour, but the damage had been done. Still ended up with
something, though. It's mostly just rehashed from my DjangoCon Europe talk.
Gotta write the new material soon...

[Asked][twitter-ask] about the current state of macOS package managers. Still
managed to avoid using any for now, but I needed to know what to use if I ever
get in an inevitable situation.

Wanted to try playing around with Ansible per Adam's and Carlton's suggestions,
but I didn't have the energy yet.

Other than that, I mostly just spent the weekend resting.
