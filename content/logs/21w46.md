## giscus üíé

A few contributors added Spanish, Swiss German, and Italian localizations this
week. We now support nine languages!

There was [a nasty bug][bug] in the React component. I've released an updated
that fixes it. A fix from inside giscus itself has also been added for good
measure.

I still haven't merged the fixed-width font toggle PR yet. Will do soon.

## Work

I'm on call this week and the next. Not very familiar with the issues, so I had
to get help from my coworkers.

For my TA work, two groups demonstrated their midterm projects. One group used
`JSONField` in one of the models. That made my day.

I also had some preparations for my next move. Still too soon to write about it,
though.

## Fun stuff

Sam and I skipped our session this week because he wants to prepare for an
interview on Tuesday. He did make some UI improvements to our project, though.

My friends and I played badminton again on Saturday üè∏

It was fun, as always. We also had brunch together after that. We'll play again
next Sunday.

I still regularly practice on the instrument.

She had to attend a relative's wedding on the weekend. We're planning to do some
activities two weeks from now.
