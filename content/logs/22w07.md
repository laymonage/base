## giscus ðŸ’Ž

Fixed _another_ nasty bug that could cause a crash.

If a comment author's user account has been deleted, GitHub replaces it with the
[@ghost][ghost] user account. However, it only does so on the website. On the
API, it returns `null` instead. My assumption in the code would break the
comment component when this happens, crashing the application. The fix is to
replace the `null` with [a hardcoded **@ghost** user][hardcoded-ghost].

Also removed the dependency on [iframe-resizer][iframe-resizer]. Replaced it
with a custom solution using [`ResizeObserver`][resize-observer] and
[`postMessage`][post-message]. Seems to work wonders. Also updated the
[giscus component library][giscus-component] to use that solution.

Speaking of which... the giscus component library is getting a bit tough to
maintain. I experimented with [Lit][lit] to build the component as a Web
Component instead, so that it can be used with any framework/library. Managed to
get it working, but I haven't figured out how to make type checking working when
using it in a React/Vue/Svelte project.
[The package has been published][giscus], but it's still very early and the repo
hasn't been pushed.

## Work

No work!

## Fun stuff

I've mostly been playing Resident Evil 4 with the HD project and recording it.
I'm about to start the Island part of the game. Videos are up on my
[YouTube channel][re4hd-playlist].

Had a chat with Sam. Somehow that ended up with us travelling around the world
on Street View. That was fun.

Like last week, I went for a morning walk on Saturday. It was refreshing, as
always.
