Dependencies updates and a minor fix for one of the languages.

Started working on [a feature][input-position] to place the comment input box at
the top. Still needs some polish before it can be merged, though.

## Work

Did a lot of refactoring to remove some abstractions. Duplication isn't worse
than hastily made abstractions.

## Fun stuff

Watched Joker for the first time on Friday. Yeah, late to the party. Anyway, I
think it's a good movie. I like how it can stand on its own if you disregard the
Batman connection. It works just like a thriller.

Went for a morning walk around the neighborhood with Sam on Saturday. We had
breakfast together at a small _nasi kebuli_ shop. It was raining as we finished
eating, so we sat for about an hour.

We continued to walk and bought some drinks at a nearby convenience store.
Talked about some personal background stuff that we had never discussed before.
It was really interesting considering I've known him for almost eight years yet
we never really talked about it before.

After that, we rode my motorbike to a friend's house. He recently had his
bachelor thesis defense, so we went there to celebrate. There were five of us
and we were just chilling for the entire day. Sam and I rode around the area
and took the long way home until past 8 PM. I drove the entire time. It was so
much fun ðŸ˜„

Spent the Sunday just resting. Wasn't really in the mood to play games. I read
[Escape Room on Webtoon][escape-room] instead. I think I started reading it
almost two years ago then kinda forgot about it. Binged the series until the
latest (free) episode. It's pretty good!
