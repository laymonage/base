## giscus ðŸ’Ž

I finally implemented an option to put the comment input box at the top, so that
users don't have to scroll all the way down to leave a comment. In addition, I
also added the buttons to sort the comments (oldest first vs. newest first).
It's all done from client-side though, since GitHub hasn't added ordering
support in their GraphQL API for Discussions.

Upgraded some dependencies, made some cleanups, and fixed some minor issues.

Someone also added Russian language support. Fifteen languages now.

## Work

Documented most of our frontend configuration in my handover document. It was
quite a lot. I also have explained some parts of it to my teammates.

Last day next week.

## Fun stuff

Watched [Taxi Driver][taxi-driver] and [Nocturnal Animals][nocturnal-animals] on
Friday. Those were a rollercoaster. Taxi Driver was quite unpredictable, so I
kinda just tried to sit back and enjoy the ride <sup><sub>(heh)</sub></sup>.
Nocturnal Animals was brilliant. The dual narratives of different genres worked
really well, and seeing the parallels between the two were satisfying.

Sam and I talked for about an hour on Saturday, then I offered to watch a
movie. I had a few suggestions and we decided to watch [Memento][memento]. I've
watched the movie a few times before, but I think the last time was back in
high school. Sam said he hadn't watched it before.

We tried using [Syncplay] and it worked well. As for the movie, it's great. It's
one of my all-time favorites. I think I caught some new things I didn't catch
before.

Played a lot of Yakuza 0 on the weekend. Even stayed up late on Sunday to finish
the game. The story is just so well-written, I love it. There were too many side
quests for my liking and the gameplay gets a bit repetitive, so I decided to
rush for the story. The main characters are unique, and the actors did a good
job making them captivating. I highly recommend it. I'll probably pick up Yakuza
Kiwami 1 and 2, seeing that they're currently on sale.

Also, the [Resident Evil 4 HD Project][re4hd] will be released next week, and
I [think][re4hd-tweet] I'm gonna record my playthrough.
