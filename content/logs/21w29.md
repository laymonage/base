  Returning to books, updated my PR, had some rest, and a question.

I started reading books again. I still have a lot of books I haven't read.

This week, I read [Thirteen Reasons Why][13rw]. I bought the book three
years ago on a short trip with my friend.

It was interesting. I liked how the double narrative works for the story,
and how the writer utilized it effectively. The story touches some highly
sensitive topics, though, so it made me feel uneasy at times.

Not much stuff going on at work this week. We're starting a new integration
project soon, and it looks quite complex. I hope it goes smoothly.

I wrote some tests and docs for my [PR to Django][pr]. Not sure if I've covered
everything, though. We'll see after the review.

I didn't do much on giscus. I initially planned to refactor the styling, but
I didn't feel like doing more programming.

I continued practicing things with the instrument. I think I made some good
progress this week, even though I didn't follow the course that I'm taking.

I'm not feeling so good this weekend for some reason. I didn't even feel like
playing a video game. I had planned to watch a movie instead, but I also ended
up not doing it and went to sleep instead.

Also, there's been a lot of sad news everywhere. I even dreamed about some
deaths, two nights in a row. Waking up crying is not the best way to start the
day. Ugh.

Something I've been thinking a lot lately: apart from my real-life friends, why
have I never seen someone my age on "tech" Twitter? Would love to see more,
honestly. It would be nice to have some friends around the world that I can
really connect with.
