## Graduation pt. 2

My graduation ceremony was supposed to have two parts on the same day: one
arranged by the university, and another one arranged by the faculty. However,
the latter was delayed because one of the volunteers tested positive for
COVID-19. Thus, I had [another ceremony][graduation] on Saturday.

## More front-end stuff

It's the second week of my full-time job. I wrote more React code to implement
the layout of a few pages and their API integration. I think I'm starting to
get the hang of it!

On the side, I also learned how to use the [SWR][swr] library to apply the
[`stale-while-revalidate`][rfc5861] HTTP cache invalidation strategy when
calling APIs. I used it to implement a Now Playing widget that shows what track
I'm currently listening to on Spotify. You can see the result on my
[about][about] page.

## Cloud storage

I don't have a lot of experience working with cloud storage APIs. In
particular, S3 or S3-compatible APIs, which seem to be what people use
nowadays. I feel like I need to learn more about them, but I don't want to
spend a considerable amount of money on S3 just yet.

I explored some cheaper options. I found [Backblaze B2][b2] and
[Wasabi][wasabi] to be the most affordable. The latter requires you to pay for
1 TB minimum, while the former gives you 10 GB for free. Both options use the
PAYG model after that. I chose B2 because I don't have a lot of data to store
yet.

I want to use the B2 to store some database backups. I also might use it to
store images for this website so that I don't bloat the git repository. Still,
I need to learn how to use this thing first.

## Video games!

I used to play video games a lot. I don't play as much anymore. When I do, I
mostly play single player games. I finished Red Dead Redemption 2 around two
weeks ago and really enjoyed it.

A few days ago, a friend of mine invited me to play World of Warcraft. I don't
think I've ever played an MMO game before. I've always felt a bit intimidated
by the complexity of such games, so I never bothered to try. However, I figured
maybe it's a good idea to try at least once.

So I did. It was pretty fun! I got a bit overwhelmed by the game's complex UI
at first. The game does quite a good job of explaining the menus throughout the
game. I've only played for around 2 hours and haven't completed the intro
stage, though! I might revisit the game next weekend.
