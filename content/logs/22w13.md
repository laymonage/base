## giscus ðŸ’Ž

Made [some improvements][reactions-pr] to the reactions button popover menu.
Otherwise, not much else for giscus itself.

However, I did some hacking for a v2 of the component library so that it uses
the [web component I made][22w07]. Managed to get it working for React, Vue, and
Svelte, but I haven't tested if it works as packages for each framework. I
started from scratch for the v2, so I had to set up the cjs/esm stuff as well.
Not sure I got it right... We'll see next week, maybe.

## Work

Still working on the project and really enjoying it so far!

Also had an introduction to the Sales and Marketing team. It's interesting to
to see people from the other parts of the company. Didn't really have a chance
for that on my previous job.

## Wagtail Space US

Recorded and delivered my Wagtail Space talk on Friday. There was a slight audio
issue when the recording was played, but thankfully they sorted it out in a
minute.

I kinda feel like the talk is a bit too slow-paced, but maybe it's because I
already know what I'm saying. Also definitely could've put more stuff on the
Wagtail side.

Maybe I should've done it live instead. Then again, it was 22:30 in my timezone,
so going pre-recorded might've been the wise choice.

Glad it's done, though. That had been in the back of my mind these past few
weeks and that kind of made me feel uneasy. All things considered, I think I did
well.

Slides are available [here][slides-wagtail-jsonfield].

## Other stuff

Sam had some bad news and he wasn't in the mood for a chat. He did watch my
talk, though.

On Saturday, I watched [Good Time][good-time] and
[The One I Love][the-one-i-love]. Both are great movies and really fun to watch.
Good Time is exciting as it's a bit fast-paced. The One I Love is more
intriguing and a bit unsettling at times. The acting is superb in both movies.

Bought [Resident Evil 2 Remake][re2] on Monday. Meanwhile, the "1-Shot Demo" had
been sitting on my laptop since before the game's release, but I hadn't played
it. On Sunday, I decided to play through the demo as a warm-up.

It runs pretty well on my old laptop. Got around 40-50 fps, but I hadn't tweaked
the settings yet. I'll play the actual game next week and see if I can get a
better performance/quality balance.

Anyway, Leon looks so innocent in this one ðŸ˜³
Makes sense as he's still a rookie in RE2's story, though. He's pretty badass in
RE4. I didn't like how he basically became emo in RE6.
