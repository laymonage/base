## giscus üíé

Most updates were done in giscus-component this week.

[Fixed an issue][url-fix] in giscus-component when using the URL mapping. I
think I messed it up during a refactor. A line of code referring to a variable
named `origin` was refactored into a separate method, but I didn't carry over
the variable. That didn't trigger an undefined variable warning as it ended up
using the global `origin` variable (a.k.a. `window.location.origin`), hence I
missed it.

[Added a `part` attribute][added-part] to the `<iframe>` element in the web
component so you can style it with the [`::part()`][part] selector.

New versions have been released to include those updates.

I've also updated all the dependencies in both giscus-component and giscus
itself.

## Work

[Did some refactoring][wagtail-refactoring] in Wagtail's Snippets views to use
class-based views. It's not that because class-based views are better. It's
just that we're planning to wrap the views in a `ViewSet` and then wrapping
that `ViewSet` with something else that would eventually become the "ultimate"
way to automatically have CRUD views for any Django model in Wagtail admin.

Feels good to actually _work_ on open source ‚ò∫Ô∏è

## Iftar, together ‚ò™Ô∏è

My high school friends and I had iftar (break-fasting dinner) together at one of
my friends' house. It was so great to see everyone again. We had Nasi Kebuli,
with a bunch of snacks and beverages. All delicious.

We spent hours discoursing about various topics. It was so interesting and each
of us gained a lot of new insights from one another. I think what made it so
interesting was the fact that all of us took different majors in university:

1. Economics ‚úÖ
2. Pharmacy ‚úÖ
3. Medicine ‚úÖ
4. Physics ‚úÖ
5. Statistics ‚úÖ
6. Aerospace Engineering ‚úÖ
7. Electrical Engineering ‚úÖ
8. Computer Science ‚úÖ

We talked and joked around until 10PM.

So. much. fun.

## Other stuff

Completed Leon's Resident Evil 2 Remake campaign! That was awesome. I really
enjoyed the balance between horror and action in this one. Seems that I
conserved too much items, as I had a bunch of gunpowder that could've been
crafted into ammo. Still had a bunch of herbs as well.

I'll play Claire's campaign next week.

Didn't get to play Borderlands 2 this week. Maybe next.

Had a chat with Nat again on Sunday night. We both were drawing something as we
talked and showed each other's progress. I learned some things about shading
from him, though I didn't really apply them to my current drawing. That was
really nice, though.

I'll post the result next week.
