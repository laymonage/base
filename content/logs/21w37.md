Last year, I participated in the Python Developer Survey by JetBrains.
Apparently, I was one of the lucky winners to receive the "Python Surprise Gift
Pack" from JetBrains and the PSF. The pack arrived on Monday.

I've updated this website to use Next.js 11.1 to leverage its experimental ESM
support. That took me some time because I got into some TypeScript type
mismatches in the remark and rehype plugins I use for MDX. There was also
[an incompatibility with my setup][esm-issue], but it's fixed now.

At work, the product team are still refining the requirements for the new
project. I didn't have much to work on, so I tried adding source maps to our
Sentry set up.

I couldn't get it to work. The source maps were successfully uploaded to
Sentry, and our `release` and `environment` tags are correctly configured.
However, Sentry just won't recognize the source maps. I haven't figured out how
to fix it ðŸ˜¬

On Sunday, two of my friends and I visited another friend who recently
graduated. There's a table tennis set at his house, so we played for a while.

I like table tennis even though I suck at it. I used to play it when I was
still in university, though I regret only trying it out in my sixth semester.

I wanted to try it ever since I saw the table on my campus. However, there were
always people using it and I didn't bother to wait until they finish.

In my sixth semester, we moved to a new building and we also had a table tennis
set there. It was not as crowded as the old building, so I managed to find the
table empty sometimes, and I would play with my friends.

Then the pandemic hit in the middle of the sixth semester, and I hadn't played
table tennis again until yesterday. It felt good.

I also finally completed Psychonauts 2. And when I say _complete_, it means:

![All minds and places have been completed!](/img/uploads/psychonauts2k.jpg)

![Rank 102!](/img/uploads/psychonauts2l.jpg)

I also made a digital painting, but I'm going to hold that one for next week
because it's going to be a surprise for someone.
