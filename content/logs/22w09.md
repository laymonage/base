  First week on the new job! Unfortunately got sick during most of the week...

This was a crazy week for the whole world. I don't know enough to say
_something_ about it, but I do wish things get better and that everyone stays
safe.

Not much this week, just some dependencies updates. Someone submitted a Turkish
localization but I have yet to review it.

## Work

In other, not devastating news...

This week was my first week on the new job!

Well, I haven't disclosed it here yet, so here it is:

I'm working _with_ [Torchbox][torchbox] to develop [Wagtail CMS][wagtail] and
other cool products!

I said "_with_" instead of "_at_" because I'm not officially an employee
<sup><sub>(yet)</sub></sup>. I'm working remotely as a contractor.

Everybody is so nice. I also managed to [get a few PRs in][wagtail-prs] on the
first week. Really enjoying my time so far!

They gave me an allowance to buy a new laptop (yay!). I went with MacBook Pro
14" 2021 and configured it over the weekend. It's my first macOS device, so it's
going to take some time to get used to.

I'll have more exciting news later this year!

## Other stuff

Had a chat with Sam on Friday. It was relatively short, as I was tired and he
also had other plans. Still, it's nice to hear his updates and talk about my
first week on the new job.

Had a fever and a bad flu from Tuesday to Thursday. Got better by Friday, but I
still felt weak. It's possible that it's COVID... as I did went outside
[last Saturday][22w08]. Didn't take the test, though, so I can't tell.

Apart from the coughing, I'm feeling much better now.

Oh yeah, got a haircut on Sunday. Feels fresh.

Haven't reinstalled Windows on my T480. I'll do that next weekend, maybe.
