## giscus ðŸ’Ž

[Last week][21w38], I got a warning from Vercel about my free usage limit. It
turns out that lowering the memory usage limit didn't help much.

I decided to apply for sponsorship instead, even though giscus doesn't meet all
of the criteria because it uses SSR. Let's hope they accept it!

## Work

We started the new project this week. It's tough and it looks like I'm going to
be real busy for the next few weeks.

On Friday, we had fun together in an online event. Each of us ordered food, all
expenses paid by my workplace. I ordered some goat meat [satay][satay]. It was
good.

On the weekend, I was busy doing some teaching assistant duties. The students
demonstrated their assignments and I graded them. It's a bit exhausting 'cause
the way the students scheduled their demonstrations made my schedule sparse.
I can't do anything in between the demos.

The assignment was about the basics of Django's URL dispatcher and the MTV
stuff. The new curriculum is a bit weird though, because they're introduced a
bit too early. Some students have not fully understood the core concepts yet.

## Entertainment & Friends

Unfortunately, I feel like I didn't have much free time this week. I feel
tired, so I mostly just had passive entertainment.

I watched [Funny Games][funny-games] on Sunday. It was interesting, but also
frustrating to watch.

There was another group of first-year students who wanted to get to know me and
my friends. It went pretty much the same way as the group in last week.

On Saturday, a student organization in my faculty asked me to have a
[fireside chat][ristek-fireside] and talk about my experience in open source.
They're trying to get new contributors to their open source projects and
introduce other students to open source in general. It's a good initiative, and
I'm happy to see it.

[Sam][sam] has been learning Django, so I've also been helping him understand the
basics. He's picking things up quickly and I'm really happy to see his
progress. If all goes well, we hope he can land an internship by the end of
this year or early next year.

[My friend][tan] from university got me started playing Final Fantasy XIV. Just
like other MMORPGs, the UI is quite complex. However, I think it's more
friendly than WoW, so it didn't really overwhelm me. I also played with a
controller, so that might have helped.

I've heard about the game a lot, but I wasn't sure if it's worth the
subscription. However, they made updates to the free trial last year and the
base game plus the first expansion pack are now free.

I only played for about three hours, but I did enjoy it! The music is great,
too. I'm definitely going to play some more next weekend.
