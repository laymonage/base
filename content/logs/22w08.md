## giscus ðŸ’Ž

Fixed a rare case where browsers would honor the `X-Frame-Options` header
despite allowing the origin in the `frame-ancestors` CSP.
[Some extensions][extensions] seem to trigger this behavior, even on new
browsers that support CSP.

Fixed some layout issues that caused the iframe to be clipped sometimes.

Also fixed an issue where SWR mutations would be incorrectly handled when the
comments are ordered by newest-first.

Dropped next-plugin-preact as it seems to be unmaintained and causing issues.
Replaced it with a simple webpack resolve alias which seems to work. Upgraded
Next.js to v12.1.0. I also did these changes for this website.

## Work

Still no work!

I did configure a new Linux user account for my new workplace, though. Had to
find a way to enable disk encryption for that user account's home directory. I
managed to do it thanks to the Arch Linux wiki. I'll probably write a blog post
on that later.

They gave me access to a bunch of accounts for work. Things are looking great
for the next week!

## Fun stuff

I've finished the main Resident Evil 4 campaign. I must say, the HD project
is _really_ good. It's so faithful to the original game's design, so it doesn't
get in the way. I've recorded all the chapters, but I'll upload them to YouTube
one by one over the next few days.

Talked about a lot of things with Sam on Friday. We exchanged our thoughts on
some specific matters in life. Talking about these things reassured me that some
unfortunate things just happen for the better.

I did not went for a morning walk on Saturday. Instead, I attended an annual
[Wikimedia Indonesia][wmid] meeting. I've been a member for five years. There's
an election for the new general chairperson this year. It was nice to see some
familiar faces. I think I hadn't met them for three years.

## Not fun stuff!!!
