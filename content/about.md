title: About Me
---

Hi, I'm Sage. I build up and break down stuff in the open. Recently, I finished
my Computer Science study at Universitas Indonesia. Now, I work full-time as a
Software Engineer at [GudangAda][gudangada].

I mostly work with Python and TypeScript. I enjoy using Django and I have made
some contributions to it. During [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] 2019, I
implemented a [`JSONField`][jsonfield] feature for all database systems
supported by Django. The feature was merged and included in the Django 3.1
release. I spoke about it at the [DjangoCon Europe 2020][djceu2020] virtual
event and an episode of the [DjangoChat][djangochat] podcast.

I love learning new things. Recently, I've been diving into front-end web
development and trying out React, Vue, and Svelte while studying the
differences between them. For this website, I settled with React, Next.js,
Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

I grew up in small districts of Jakarta. I spend my free time writing, reading,
playing music, and enjoying time alone or with my friends and family. I also
play [video games][steam] occasionally.
