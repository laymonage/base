Hello, world!

Last month, I submitted a project proposal to [Django Software Foundation][dsf]
for [Google Summer of Code 2019][gsoc]. It's titled `Add Cross-DB JSONField and ArrayField`, which aims to—you guessed it—bring native support for `JSONField`
and `ArrayField` for all of the database backends supported by
[Django][django].

Thankfully, [the project][project] has been accepted, which means I will spend
my summer by coding <sup><sub>(yay!)</sub></sup> and documenting the feature. I
decided to start this blog and make this the place for me to document my
journey. Hopefully, this will be useful for me and anyone else in the future.

This blog is made using [Hugo][hugo] <sup><sub>(not Django, heh)</sub></sup>
with [Hello Friend NG][hello] theme and deployed using [Netlify][netlify]. You
can see the repository on [GitHub][repo].

I guess that's it for this initial commit. Stay tuned for my journey!
